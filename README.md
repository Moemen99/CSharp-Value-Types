## Introduction to Value Types in C#

Value types are one of the two main categories of types in C#, the other being reference types. Understanding value types is crucial for efficient memory management and performance optimization in C# programming.

## What are Value Types?

Value types are data types that hold the data within their own memory allocation. When you declare a value type, a single space in memory is allocated to store the value, and that variable directly contains the data.

## Key Characteristics of Value Types

1. **Direct Storage**: The value is stored directly on the stack, or inline inside a containing type.
2. **Copy Behavior**: When you assign a value type to another variable, a copy of the value is created.
3. **Performance**: Generally faster for small, simple data structures due to stack allocation.
4. **Scope**: When a value type goes out of scope, it is immediately removed from the stack.
5. **Default Values**: Value types always have a default value and cannot be null (unless declared as nullable).

## Categories of Value Types

1. **Simple Types**: Also known as primitive types (e.g., int, float, bool).
2. **Struct Types**: User-defined structures that can encapsulate data and related functionality.
3. **Enum Types**: Used to define constants and their underlying values.

## Example

```csharp
int x = 10; // 'x' is a value type
int y = x;  // 'y' gets a copy of the value of 'x'

y = 20;     // Changing 'y' does not affect 'x'
Console.WriteLine(x); // Still outputs 10
```

## Memory Allocation

```
Stack
+---------------+
| x     |  10   |
+---------------+
| y     |  20   |
+---------------+
```

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll explore each category of value types in detail, starting with [Primitive Value Types](02_PrimitiveTypes.md).



# Primitive Value Types in C#

Primitive types are the most basic data types available in C# and are all value types. They are the building blocks for data manipulation in C# programs.

## Common Primitive Types

1. **Integer Types**
   - `sbyte`: 8-bit signed integer
   - `byte`: 8-bit unsigned integer
   - `short`: 16-bit signed integer
   - `ushort`: 16-bit unsigned integer
   - `int`: 32-bit signed integer
   - `uint`: 32-bit unsigned integer
   - `long`: 64-bit signed integer
   - `ulong`: 64-bit unsigned integer

2. **Floating-Point Types**
   - `float`: 32-bit single-precision IEEE 754 floating point
   - `double`: 64-bit double-precision IEEE 754 floating point

3. **Decimal Type**
   - `decimal`: 128-bit precise decimal values

4. **Boolean Type**
   - `bool`: Represents true or false

5. **Character Type**
   - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character

## Examples and Memory Allocation

```csharp
int i = 42;
float f = 3.14f;
bool b = true;
char c = 'A';

Console.WriteLine($"int: {i}, float: {f}, bool: {b}, char: {c}");
```

Memory allocation on the stack:

```
Stack
+---------------+
| i     |  42   | 4 bytes
+---------------+
| f     | 3.14  | 4 bytes
+---------------+
| b     | true  | 1 byte
+---------------+
| c     |  'A'  | 2 bytes
+---------------+
```

## Key Points

1. Primitive types are value types and stored on the stack.
2. They have a fixed size in memory.
3. Operations on primitive types are generally faster than on reference types.
4. Each primitive type has a range of values it can represent.
5. Implicit and explicit conversions are possible between some primitive types.

## Example: Type Conversion

```csharp
int intValue = 10;
long longValue = intValue;  // Implicit conversion
float floatValue = 3.14f;
int roundedValue = (int)floatValue;  // Explicit conversion (casting)

Console.WriteLine($"Long: {longValue}, Rounded Int: {roundedValue}");
```

## Best Practices

- Choose the appropriate type based on the range of values you need to represent.
- Be aware of potential overflow issues when working with arithmetic operations.
- Use `checked` contexts when you want to enable runtime checking for arithmetic overflow.

## Next Steps

Explore [Structs](03_Structs.md) to learn about user-defined value types that can encapsulate related data and functionality.


# Structs in C#

Structs are user-defined value types that can encapsulate data and related functionality. They are useful for creating lightweight objects and are particularly efficient when you have small data structures that have value semantics.

## Defining a Struct

```csharp
public struct Point
{
    public int X { get; set; }
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public Point(int x, int y)
    {
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }

    public double Distance(Point other)
    {
        int dx = X - other.X;
        int dy = Y - other.Y;
        return Math.Sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);
    }
}
```

## Key Characteristics of Structs

1. **Value Type**: Structs are value types and are stored on the stack.
2. **Cannot Inherit**: Structs cannot inherit from other structs or classes, but they can implement interfaces.
3. **Can Have Methods**: Unlike primitive types, structs can have methods, properties, and fields.
4. **Default Constructor**: Structs always have a public parameterless constructor, even if you don't define one.
5. **Performance**: Generally more efficient than classes for small data structures.

## Using Structs

```csharp
Point p1 = new Point(3, 4);
Point p2 = p1; // Creates a copy of p1

p2.X = 7; // Doesn't affect p1

Console.WriteLine($"p1: ({p1.X}, {p1.Y})"); // Output: p1: (3, 4)
Console.WriteLine($"p2: ({p2.X}, {p2.Y})"); // Output: p2: (7, 4)

double distance = p1.Distance(p2);
Console.WriteLine($"Distance: {distance}");
```

## Memory Allocation

```
Stack
+---------------+
| p1.X  |   3   |
| p1.Y  |   4   |
+---------------+
| p2.X  |   7   |
| p2.Y  |   4   |
+---------------+
```

## When to Use Structs

- When the structure is small (generally less than 16 bytes).
- When the structure is immutable.
- When instances of the structure are short-lived.
- When the structure will not be boxed frequently.

## Best Practices

1. Keep structs small and immutable when possible.
2. Override `Equals()` and `GetHashCode()` for value equality comparisons.
3. Implement the `IEquatable<T>` interface for better performance in collections.
4. Be cautious with mutable structs as they can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Next Steps

Explore [Enums](04_Enums.md) to learn about another important value type used for defining named constants in C#.


# Enums in C#

Enums (short for enumerations) are value types in C# used to define named constants. They provide a way to create a set of named values that can be assigned to a variable.

## Defining an Enum

```csharp
public enum DaysOfWeek
{
    Sunday,    // 0
    Monday,    // 1
    Tuesday,   // 2
    Wednesday, // 3
    Thursday,  // 4
    Friday,    // 5
    Saturday   // 6
}
```

## Key Characteristics of Enums

1. **Value Type**: Enums are value types and are stored on the stack.
2. **Underlying Type**: By default, the underlying type is `int`, but this can be changed.
3. **Named Constants**: Each enum member is a named constant.
4. **Implicit Values**: By default, enum members are assigned increasing integer values starting from 0.

## Using Enums

```csharp
DaysOfWeek today = DaysOfWeek.Wednesday;
Console.WriteLine(today); // Output: Wednesday

// Casting between enum and integer
int dayNumber = (int)today;
Console.WriteLine(dayNumber); // Output: 3

DaysOfWeek convertedDay = (DaysOfWeek)3;
Console.WriteLine(convertedDay); // Output: Wednesday
```

## Specifying Enum Values

You can explicitly specify the values for enum members:

```csharp
public enum FileAccess
{
    Read = 1,
    Write = 2,
    ReadWrite = Read | Write, // 3
    Execute = 4
}
```

## Enum with Different Base Type

```csharp
public enum LongEnum : long
{
    Max = 9223372036854775807,
    Min = -9223372036854775808
}
```

## Useful Enum Methods

- `Enum.GetNames()`: Returns an array of the names of the constants.
- `Enum.GetValues()`: Returns an array of the values of the constants.
- `Enum.Parse()`: Converts a string to its enum equivalent.
- `Enum.TryParse()`: Safely attempts to convert a string to an enum value.

## Best Practices

1. Use enums for distinct sets of named constants.
2. Consider using the [Flags] attribute for enums representing bitwise flags.
3. Be cautious when explicitly assigning values to ensure uniqueness.
4. Use PascalCase for enum names and members.

## Example: Using [Flags] Attribute

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum Permissions
{
    None = 0,
    Read = 1,
    Write = 2,
    Execute = 4,
    All = Read | Write | Execute
}

Permissions userPermissions = Permissions.Read | Permissions.Write;
Console.WriteLine(userPermissions); // Output: Read, Write
```

## Next Steps

Explore [Memory Allocation for Value Types](05_MemoryAllocation.md) to understand how value types are stored and managed in memory.


# Memory Allocation for Value Types in C#

Understanding how value types are allocated in memory is crucial for optimizing performance and managing resources effectively in C# applications.

## Stack vs Heap

- **Stack**: A region of memory where value types are typically stored.
- **Heap**: A region of memory where reference types (objects) are stored.

## Value Types and the Stack

1. **Direct Storage**: Value types are stored directly on the stack.
2. **Fixed Size**: The memory allocated is of a fixed size, determined at compile-time.
3. **Fast Allocation/Deallocation**: Allocating and deallocating on the stack is very fast.
4. **Scope-Based Lifetime**: When a method completes, its stack frame is popped off, automatically cleaning up value types.

## Memory Layout Example

Consider the following code:

```csharp
public struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;
}

public void MethodA()
{
    int a = 5;
    Point p = new Point { X = 10, Y = 20 };
    MethodB(p);
}

public void MethodB(Point point)
{
    int b = 15;
    // Method body
}
```

The stack might look like this during execution:

```
Stack (grows downward)
+------------------+
|    MethodB       |
| b         |  15  |
| point.Y   |  20  |
| point.X   |  10  |
+------------------+
|    MethodA       |
| p.Y       |  20  |
| p.X       |  10  |
| a         |   5  |
+------------------+
```

## Value Types in Classes

When value types are fields in a class, they are allocated as part of the object on the heap:

```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
    public Point TopLeft;
    public Point BottomRight;
}

Rectangle rect = new Rectangle 
{ 
    TopLeft = new Point { X = 0, Y = 0 },
    BottomRight = new Point { X = 100, Y = 100 }
};
```

Memory layout:

```
Stack                  Heap
+-----------+          +------------------------+
| rect      |--------->| Rectangle Object       |
| [Reference]          | TopLeft.X    |    0    |
+-----------+          | TopLeft.Y    |    0    |
                       | BottomRight.X|  100    |
                       | BottomRight.Y|  100    |
                       +------------------------+
```

## Performance Implications

1. **Fast Access**: Value types on the stack are generally faster to access.
2. **No Garbage Collection**: Value types on the stack don't involve the garbage collector.
3. **Copy Semantics**: Assigning or passing value types creates a copy, which can be expensive for large structs.

## Best Practices

1. Use value types for small, simple structures.
2. Be cautious with large value types, as copying can impact performance.
3. Consider using `ref` or `in` parameters for large structs to avoid copying.
4. Be aware of value type fields in classes, as they contribute to the overall object size.

## Next Steps

Explore [Boxing and Unboxing](06_BoxingUnboxing.md) to understand how value types interact with the object type system in C#.


# Boxing and Unboxing in C#

Boxing and unboxing are processes that enable value types to be treated as objects. These operations are important to understand for performance considerations and type safety.

## Boxing

Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the type `object` or to any interface type implemented by this value type.

### How Boxing Works

1. A new object is allocated on the managed heap.
2. The value is copied into the new object.

### Example of Boxing

```csharp
int i = 123;
object boxed = i;  // Boxing occurs here
```

Memory representation:

```
Stack              Heap
+-------+          +-------------+
|   i   |          |    boxed    |
| (123) |          | +-------+   |
+-------+          | |  123  |   |
                   | +-------+   |
                   +-------------+
```

## Unboxing

Unboxing is the process of converting the object reference back to a value type.

### How Unboxing Works

1. Check that the object instance is a boxed value of the given value type.
2. Copy the value from the instance into the value type variable.

### Example of Unboxing

```csharp
object boxed = 123;
int j = (int)boxed;  // Unboxing occurs here
```

## Performance Implications

- Boxing and unboxing are computationally expensive operations.
- They require memory allocation and copy operations.
- Frequent boxing and unboxing can lead to performance issues and increased memory usage.

## Common Scenarios for Boxing

1. When passing a value type to a method that takes an `object` parameter.
2. When storing a value type in a collection that stores `object` types.

```csharp
ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
list.Add(10);  // Boxing occurs here
```

## Avoiding Unnecessary Boxing

1. Use generics where possible.
2. Use strongly-typed collections instead of collections of `object`.

```csharp
List<int> list = new List<int>();
list.Add(10);  // No boxing occurs
```

## Best Practices

1. Be aware of implicit boxing, especially when using non-generic collections or methods.
2. Use generic types and methods to avoid boxing when working with value types.
3. Consider the performance impact when designing APIs that might cause frequent boxing/unboxing.

## Next Steps

Explore [Value Types vs Reference Types](07_ValueVsReference.md) to understand the key differences and when to use each.



# Value Types vs Reference Types in C#

Understanding the differences between value types and reference types is crucial for effective C# programming. These two categories of types have different behaviors in terms of memory allocation, assignment, and passing as method parameters.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Value Types | Reference Types |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Memory allocation | Stack (usually) | Heap |
| Default value | Zero/null equivalent | null |
| Assignment behavior | Creates a copy | Creates a reference |
| Passing to methods | By value (copy) | By reference |
| Garbage collection | Not subject to GC | Subject to GC |
| Inheritance | Cannot inherit | Can inherit |
| Examples | int, struct, enum | class, interface, delegate, array |

## Memory Allocation

### Value Types
```csharp
int x = 10;
```
```
Stack
+-------+
|   x   |
| (10)  |
+-------+
```

### Reference Types
```csharp
class Person { public string Name; }
Person p = new Person();
```
```
Stack              Heap
+-------+          +-------------+
|   p   |--------->|   Person    |
|  ref  |          | Name: null  |
+-------+          +-------------+
```

## Assignment Behavior

### Value Types
```csharp
int a = 10;
int b = a;  // 'b' gets a copy of 'a'
b = 20;     // Doesn't affect 'a'
```

### Reference Types
```csharp
Person p1 = new Person { Name = "Alice" };
Person p2 = p1;  // 'p2' references the same object as 'p1'
p2.Name = "Bob"; // Changes are visible through both 'p1' and 'p2'
```

## Method Parameters

### Value Types
```csharp
void Increment(int x)
{
    x++;  // Only affects the local copy
}

int number = 5;
Increment(number);  // 'number' is still 5
```

### Reference Types
```csharp
void ChangeName(Person p)
{
    p.Name = "Charlie";  // Affects the original object
}

Person person = new Person { Name = "Alice" };
ChangeName(person);  // person.Name is now "Charlie"
```

## Performance Considerations

- Value types are generally more efficient for small data structures.
- Reference types can be more efficient for large data structures or when sharing is needed.
- Frequent boxing/unboxing of value types can impact performance.

## When to Use Each

### Use Value Types When:
- The data structure is small (generally < 16 bytes).
- The type has value semantics (equality based on value, not identity).
- Instances are short-lived or frequently created/destroyed.

### Use Reference Types When:
- The data structure is large.
- You need to inherit from the type.
- You need reference semantics (equality based on identity).
- You need to share instances across multiple parts of your code.

## Best Practices

1. Choose between value and reference types based on the semantics of your data, not just size.
2. Be aware of performance implications, especially with large structs.
3. Use `ref` or `in` parameters for large value types to avoid copying.
4. Consider immutability for both value and reference types for safer code.

## Next Steps

Explore [Nullable Value Types](08_NullableValueTypes.md) to learn how C# allows value types to represent null values.


# Nullable Value Types in C#

Nullable value types combine the efficiency of value types with the ability to represent null values, which is traditionally a characteristic of reference types. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with databases or any scenario where a value might be missing or undefined.

## Syntax

Nullable value types are denoted by appending a question mark (`?`) to the type:

```csharp
int? nullableInt = null;
double? nullableDouble = 3.14;
bool? nullableBool = null;
```

## How Nullable Types Work

- Nullable types are instances of the `System.Nullable<T>` struct.
- They consist of two fields: the value itself and a boolean indicating whether the value is null.

## Properties of Nullable Types

- `HasValue`: Returns `true` if the instance contains a value, `false` if it's null.
- `Value`: Gets the value if `HasValue` is true. Throws `InvalidOperationException` if `HasValue` is false.

```csharp
int? x = 10;
if (x.HasValue)
{
    Console.WriteLine(x.Value);  // Outputs: 10
}
```

## Null Coalescing Operator (??)

The `??` operator provides a concise way to handle null values:

```csharp
int? nullableNum = null;
int result = nullableNum ?? 0;  // result will be 0
```

## Nullable Types in Conditionals

Nullable types can be used directly in conditional statements:

```csharp
bool? isEnabled = null;

if (isEnabled == true)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Explicitly enabled");
}
else if (isEnabled == false)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Explicitly disabled");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Neither enabled nor disabled (null)");
}
```

## Boxing and Unboxing with Nullable Types

Nullable types have special boxing and unboxing behavior:

```csharp
int? x = 5;
object o = x;  // Boxes to 5, not to a nullable int
int? y = (int?)o;  // Unboxes back to a nullable int
```

## Use Cases

1. **Database Interactions**: Representing nullable columns in databases.
2. **Optional Parameters**: In methods where a parameter might not always be needed.
3. **Return Values**: When a method might not always have a valid return value.

## Performance Considerations

- Nullable types are slightly larger and slower than their non-nullable counterparts.
- They involve a small overhead due to the additional boolean flag.

## Best Practices

1. Use nullable types judiciously, primarily for representing truly optional values.
2. Always check `HasValue` before accessing `Value` to avoid exceptions.
3. Consider using the null coalescing operator for providing default values.
4. Be aware of the performance implications when using nullable types extensively.

## C# 8.0 and Nullable Reference Types

With C# 8.0, Microsoft introduced nullable reference types, extending the concept of nullability to reference types:

```csharp
#nullable enable
string? nullableString = null;  // Explicitly nullable
string nonNullableString = "Hello";  // Cannot be null
```

This feature helps in preventing null reference exceptions by enforcing null checks at compile-time.

## Next Steps

Explore [Performance Considerations](09_Performance.md) to understand how different uses of value types can impact your application's performance.


# Performance Considerations for Value Types in C#

Understanding the performance implications of value types is crucial for writing efficient C# code. This section explores various scenarios where value types can impact performance and provides strategies for optimization.

## Stack vs Heap Allocation

### Advantages of Stack Allocation
- Faster allocation and deallocation
- Better cache locality
- No garbage collection overhead

```csharp
struct Point { public int X, Y; }

void StackAllocationExample()
{
    Point p = new Point { X = 1, Y = 2 };  // Allocated on the stack
    // Use p...
}  // p is automatically deallocated when the method ends
```

### When Heap Allocation Occurs
- When boxing value types
- When using value types as generic type arguments in reference type instantiations

```csharp
object boxed = 42;  // Boxed on the heap
List<int> list = new List<int>();  // List<T> is a reference type, so it's on the heap
```

## Copying Behavior

Value types are copied when assigned or passed as parameters, which can be expensive for large structs.

```csharp
struct LargeStruct
{
    public long Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4;  // 32 bytes total
}

void CopyExample(LargeStruct s)  // Expensive copy operation
{
    // Use s...
}
```

### Optimization: Using `ref` Parameters
```csharp
void RefExample(ref LargeStruct s)  // No copy, just passes a reference
{
    // Use s...
}
```

## Method Calls on Value Types

Calling methods on value types can lead to unexpected copying:

```csharp
struct MutableStruct
{
    public int Value;
    public void Increment() => Value++;
}

MutableStruct s = new MutableStruct();
s.Increment();  // This creates a copy, modifies it, and discards it
```

### Optimization: Using `ref` for Method Calls
```csharp
ref MutableStruct GetStruct() => ref s;
GetStruct().Increment();  // Modifies the original struct
```

## Generic Type Constraints

Using value types with generic methods can lead to boxing:

```csharp
void GenericMethod<T>(T value) where T : IComparable
{
    // This may box value types
}
```

### Optimization: Constraining to Struct
```csharp
void GenericMethod<T>(T value) where T : struct, IComparable
{
    // No boxing occurs
}
```

## Nullable Value Types

Nullable value types have a small performance overhead:

```csharp
int? nullableInt = 42;  // Slightly larger than a regular int
```

### Consideration
Use nullable types only when necessary, as they introduce additional memory usage and potential for branching in your code.

## SIMD and Value Types

Value types can be optimized for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations:

```csharp
using System.Numerics;

Vector<float> v1 = new Vector<float>(1.0f);
Vector<float> v2 = new Vector<float>(2.0f);
Vector<float> result = v1 + v2;  // Efficient SIMD operation
```

## Benchmarking

Always measure performance in your specific use case. Use tools like BenchmarkDotNet for accurate measurements:

```csharp
[Benchmark]
public void ValueTypeMethod()
{
    // Method to benchmark
}
```

## Best Practices for Performance

1. Keep value types small (generally < 16 bytes).
2. Use `ref`, `in`, and `ref readonly` for large structs to avoid copying.
3. Be cautious with mutable structs, as they can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues.
4. Use value types in performance-critical code paths where allocation and garbage collection overhead matter.
5. Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks before optimizing.

## Next Steps

Explore [Best Practices and Common Pitfalls](10_BestPractices.md) to learn about recommended practices and potential issues when working with value types in C#.




# Best Practices and Common Pitfalls for Value Types in C#

Working effectively with value types in C# requires understanding both best practices and common pitfalls. This section provides guidelines to help you use value types efficiently and avoid common mistakes.

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep Value Types Small

- Aim for structs smaller than 16 bytes.
- Large structs can lead to performance issues due to copying.

```csharp
// Good: Small, focused struct
struct Point2D
{
    public float X;
    public float Y;
}

// Avoid: Large struct
struct LargeStruct
{
    public long Field1, Field2, Field3, Field4, Field5, Field6, Field7, Field8;
}
```

### 2. Make Value Types Immutable

- Immutability prevents unexpected side effects and makes code easier to reason about.

```csharp
// Good: Immutable struct
readonly struct ImmutablePoint
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public ImmutablePoint(int x, int y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
}
```

### 3. Implement `Equals` and `GetHashCode`

- Proper implementation ensures correct behavior in collections and comparisons.

```csharp
public struct Point : IEquatable<Point>
{
    public int X { get; }
    public int Y { get; }

    public override bool Equals(object obj) => obj is Point other && Equals(other);

    public bool Equals(Point other) => X == other.X && Y == other.Y;

    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(X, Y);
}
```

### 4. Use `ref` and `in` Parameters for Large Structs

- Avoids unnecessary copying for large structs.

```csharp
public void ProcessLargeStruct(in LargeStruct ls)
{
    // Process ls without copying
}
```

### 5. Consider Implementing Custom Value Type

- When you need value semantics and the built-in types don't suffice.

```csharp
public readonly struct Percentage
{
    public decimal Value { get; }

    public Percentage(decimal value)
    {
        Value = value < 0 ? 0 : value > 100 ? 100 : value;
    }

    // Additional methods and operators...
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Unintended Copying

- Be aware that value types are copied when passed as parameters or assigned.

```csharp
struct MutablePoint { public int X, Y; }

MutablePoint p1 = new MutablePoint { X = 1, Y = 2 };
MutablePoint p2 = p1;
p2.X = 3; // Doesn't affect p1
```

### 2. Boxing and Unboxing

- Avoid situations that cause frequent boxing and unboxing.

```csharp
// Avoid: Causes boxing
object boxed = 42;
int unboxed = (int)boxed; // Unboxing

// Prefer: Use generics to avoid boxing
List<int> list = new List<int>();
```

### 3. Mutable Structs

- Mutable structs can lead to confusing behavior and are generally discouraged.

```csharp
// Avoid: Mutable struct
struct MutableStruct
{
    public int Value;
    public void Increment() => Value++;
}

// Usage can be confusing
MutableStruct ms = new MutableStruct();
ms.Increment(); // This doesn't actually modify ms
```

### 4. Default Constructor Limitations

- Structs always have a public parameterless constructor that you can't remove or change.

```csharp
struct Point
{
    public int X, Y;

    // This won't prevent the default constructor
    public Point(int x, int y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);
}

Point p = new Point(); // X and Y will be 0
```

### 5. Overusing Value Types

- Not everything needs to be a struct. Use classes for larger, more complex types.

```csharp
// Consider using a class instead for complex types
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
    public List<string> Hobbies { get; set; }
}
```

### 6. Forgetting to Override `Equals` and `GetHashCode`

- Can lead to unexpected behavior in collections and comparisons.

```csharp
// Avoid: Not overriding Equals and GetHashCode
struct BadPoint
{
    public int X, Y;
}

// Prefer: Properly implemented equality
struct GoodPoint : IEquatable<GoodPoint>
{
    public int X, Y;

    public override bool Equals(object obj) => obj is GoodPoint other && Equals(other);
    public bool Equals(GoodPoint other) => X == other.X && Y == other.Y;
    public override int GetHashCode() => HashCode.Combine(X, Y);
}
```

## Conclusion

By following these best practices and avoiding common pitfalls, you can effectively leverage the power of value types in C# while maintaining clean, efficient, and correct code. Remember to always consider the specific requirements of your application and use value types judiciously where they provide clear benefits.
